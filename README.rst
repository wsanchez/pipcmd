pipcmd
======

``pipcmd`` is a tool for installing and managing commands installed using pip.


Installing ``pipcmd``
---------------------

Installing ``pipcmd`` is as simple as installing the ``pipcmd`` script (``./bin/pipcmd``) in this source repository into a location in your ``PATH``.
You will also need to set ``PATH`` to include the ``${HOME}/.pipcmd/bin`` directory, which is where ``pipcmd`` will install commands.


Using ``pipcmd``
----------------

If the command you want to install is provided with a project with the same name as the command, simply ask ``pipcmd`` to install the project:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pipcmd install tox
    Installing tox from tox[latest] using python
    New python executable in /Users/wsanchez/.pipcmd/env/tox/latest/bin/python
    ...
    Successfully installed pluggy-0.6.0 py-1.5.2 six-1.11.0 tox-2.9.1 virtualenv-15.1.0

If a project provides a command with a different name, or mutiple commands, add the names of the commands to install:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pipcmd install twisted trial twist
    Installing trial twist from twisted[latest] using python
    New python executable in /Users/wsanchez/.pipcmd/env/twisted/latest/bin/python
    ...
    Successfully installed Automat-0.6.0 attrs-17.4.0 constantly-15.1.0 hyperlink-17.3.1 incremental-17.5.0 six-1.11.0 twisted-17.9.0 zope.interface-4.4.3

Note that ``pipcmd`` does not attempt to install every command provided by a project.
This avoids adding unwanted commands to your path, and in cases where a command name is used by multiple projects, it lets you be specific about which to install.

``pipcmd`` uses the ``python`` command found on the command line by default.
A different interpreter can be specified:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pipcmd install -p python3 mypy
    Installing mypy from mypy[latest] using python3
    Using base prefix '/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5'
    New python executable in /Users/wsanchez/.pipcmd/env/mypy/latest/bin/python3
    ...
    Successfully installed mypy-0.560 psutil-5.4.3 typed-ast-1.1.0

``pipcmd`` uses latest available version of a project by default.
A project can be pinned to a specific version:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pipcmd install -v 15 twisted twistd
    Installing twistd from twisted[15] using python
    New python executable in /Users/wsanchez/.pipcmd/env/twisted/15/bin/python
    ...
    Successfully installed twisted-15.0.0 zope.interface-4.4.3

Note that we've installed ``trial`` and ``twist`` from the latest version of Twisted, but ``twistd`` from Twisted 15.
That may or may not be a good idea in this case, but ``pipcmd`` doesn't judge.

To list the installed commands:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pipcmd list
    mypy from mypy[latest] using CPython 3.5.3
    tox from tox[latest] using CPython 2.7.10
    trial from twisted[latest] using CPython 2.7.10
    twist from twisted[latest] using CPython 2.7.10
    twistd from twisted[15] using CPython 2.7.10

To remove commands:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pipcmd remove twist twistd
    Removing: twist from twisted[latest] using CPython 2.7.10
    Removing: twistd from twisted[15] using CPython 2.7.10
